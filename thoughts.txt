Feature Ideas:
    - close to 2 minute warning
    - game score

    - route tendencies for players on field?
Results:
    - Feature Importance
        - How much does multicollinearity affect features
        - How much do high-level categorical variables get punished?
    - Calibration
    - Prob by Down&Distance

Future to do:
    - Turn into a sequence problem. Not as interpretable though.

XGBoost model:
- ensemble model consisting of Classification adn Regresstion Trees (CART). 
Each leave is assigned a score, as opposed to a decision value
